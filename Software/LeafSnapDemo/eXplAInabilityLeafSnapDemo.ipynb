    "*At the moment this is work in progress and in the experimental phase. If the experiment is successsful, e.g. we get meaningful heatmaps for the task, this will turn into a real demo!*\n",
    "\n",
    "**The purpose of this demo is to show the ability of DNN explainability method(s) to generate meanfingful heatmaps for the relevance of the input image pixels to the output resut of a CNN model. The task is chosen to be classification of images of leaves of 20 species of North American trees. The original dataset comes from LeafSnap - an app from 2012 for automatic classification of 185 species of trees. For this demo a subset of images taken in a lab(Smitsonian Insittute) from 20 species is used.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The explainability tool [iNNvestigate](https://github.com/albermax/innvestigate) is chosen as it offers open source implementatons of several explainability methods. Since it supports [Keras](https://keras.io/), the framework (with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) as backend) is used to genrate the CNN model(s), though our vision is to go for at least [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) deep learning library and the related [Captum](https://captum.ai/) explainability library and definitely towards using DNN model standards such as [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/). This [list of explainability tools](https://github.com/NLeSC/XAI/blob/master/State-of-the-art/AI_Explainability_OSTools.docx) sumamrizes the availability of explainability tools.\n",
