    "*At the moment this is work in progress and in the experimental phase. If the experiment is successsful, e.g. we get meaningful heatmaps for the task, this will turn into a real demo!*\n",
    "\n",
    "**The purpose of this demo is to show the ability of DNN explainability method(s) to generate meanfingful heatmaps for the relevance of the input image pixels to the output resut of a CNN model. The task is chosen to be counting shapes rather than a classical object classificaiton task to minimize human interpretation of the resulting heatmaps.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The explainability tool [iNNvestigate](https://github.com/albermax/innvestigate) is chosen as it offers open source implementatons of several explainability methods. Since it supports [Keras](https://keras.io/), the framework (with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) as backend) is used to genrate the CNN model(s), though our vision is to go for at least [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) deep learning library and the related [Captum](https://captum.ai/) explainability library and definitely towards using DNN model standards such as [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/). This [list of explainability tools](https://github.com/NLeSC/XAI/blob/master/State-of-the-art/AI_Explainability_OSTools.docx) sumamrizes the availability of explainability tools.\n",

    "The 'CNNCountDemo' code is in a [git repository](https://github.com/NLeSC/XAI/tree/master/Software/CNNcountDemo). \n",
    "Code from [Keras documentation example](https://keras.io/examples/mnist_cnn/) has been used as a starting point for the  CNN model.\n",

Please, note that if the geenrated files are deleted and the notebook ran again, the new dataset will be different that the original as many generation parameters are random (the location of the shapes is always random).\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of shapes per image for all datasets is a random number between 1 and 3. Therefore the classification result is one of the classes '1', '2' or '3, where the class corresponds to the shapes count in the image. Each shape is at a random location and occlusion is not allowed. For the images with different shapes, the type is chosen randomly from a circle, diamond or square.\n",
    "\n",
    "The images dimensions are 64x64 pixels and the datasets contain 60k images. Te shape size (or 'radius') is an integer number between 2 and 6 pixels. For the shapes with the same size (radius), the average of 4 pixels is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Dataset1Var, the radius can vary between 2 and 10 pixels."
